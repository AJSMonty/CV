I am an enthusiastic, intelligent, hard-working and thoughtful problem-solver. My experiences in the events industry have cultivated a ‘nothing is impossible’ mindset. I’ve always had a passion for tech, combined with an obsession for efficiency, which led me into software development. I have recently graduated from Makers Academy and now looking to start a new path developing world-changing applications.
